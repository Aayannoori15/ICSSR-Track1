In this project, I worked on a classification dataset and focused on building and comparing multiple machine learning models. Before training, the data was properly preprocessed so it could be used effectively by the models.

I trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. For better performance, hyperparameter tuning was done for KNN (by testing different values of k) and Decision Tree (by controlling tree depth to reduce overfitting).

After evaluating all models, the following accuracies were obtained:

Logistic Regression: 0.8219

Decision Tree: 0.8027

KNN: 0.8013

Gaussian Naive Bayes: 0.7360

Based on the results, Logistic Regression performed the best, making it the most suitable model for this dataset.
